The mii_lib contains Verilog macro definitions for the media independent
interface (MII) and a couple of flavours and derivatives thereof.

Currently included MII interface types are:
MII Media-Independent Interface
RMII Reduced Media-Independent Interface
GMII Gigabit Media-Independent Interface
RGMII Reduced Gigabit Media-Independent Interface
SGMII Serial Gigabit Media-Independent Interface
QSGMII Quad Serial Gigabit Media-Independent Interface (stub)
XGMII 10 Gigabit Media-Independent Interface

The macro definitions by default assume single ended signals.
For differential signals simply use the same macro twice, once for positive
polarity signals and once for negative polarity signals.
